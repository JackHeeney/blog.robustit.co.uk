We have just launched our brand-new Beginner Cloud Engineer Package and wanted to tell you a bit more about this exciting package and the cloud.

Cloud technology is on a steady rise but what exactly is the cloud?

## What exactly is the cloud?

The cloud (or cloud computing) refers to Internet-based provision of storage, computing power, or application software as a service. When a tech company tells you that your data is in the cloud, it means that your data is being stored somewhere on the Internet and not locally on your computer/device. It is what allows you to make edits to that file in Google docs at home, and then pick up your editing when you get to the office.

Examples of some of the most popular cloud services include Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive.

## What does your Beginners Cloud Package include?

Our Beginners Cloud Package is here to take you from beginner to expert, with 7 professional certifications that will get you started in your Cloud Engineering career!

Included are the following certifications - Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, Microsoft Security Compliance and Identity Fundamentals, AWS Cloud Practitioner, Microsoft Certified Modern Desktop Administration Associate Windows 10, CompTIA Network+, Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator Associate, Microsoft Office 365 Certified Enterprise Administrator Expert.

If you are considering a career in the cloud sector, you will need certain certifications to show your skills and knowledge in the cloud and how it works. Our package includes the 7 certifications that are in high demand by employers, and will help you land your first role.

## Do I need experience?

The package was designed for those with limited cloud and IT experience so that you are able to start your journey right at the beginning and work up to expert level!

## What career will I be able to go into?

Once completing our package, you will be able to go into many different job roles such as a Cloud Platform Engineer, a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer, a Cloud Solutions Architect, and many more.

This package will open up your world to the career of cloud computing, and let you take your career to the next level!
