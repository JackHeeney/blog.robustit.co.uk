Taking time away from work and our screens is getting harder and harder as we are working from home more than ever, and spending our free time using technology.

Whether you are WFH, or you are a student studying from home - screens have become what we spend most of our time on!

Therefore, it is more important than ever right now to take time away from the screen, and it is something that we all need to focus on and do more of. Giving our eyes and mind a break from technology is essential and a powerful way to improve our well-being.

We all deserve time away and a well-earned break, especially right now. Your work will still be there tomorrow and turning the screen off and taking time away will help you to increase your productivity, think clearer, reduce stress as well as many other benefits!

You must make sure to always put yourself and your health first and taking time away from your screen is a crucial element to that!

Practising self-care is not easy, and me-time is usually last on all our agendas. But it is that me-time and self-care that will help you to feel better and disconnect from your screen.

Here are my top 5 suggestions of what to do once the screen is turned off:

## Spend time outside:

Going on a walk can help you both mentally and physically, and studies show that spending time outdoors can help reduce fatigue meaning you will get less tired and burnt out. Daily walks can also help reduce anxiety and stress and boost your mood. It also allows you to move and stretch your legs.

Even if you just want to go and sit in your garden/in a park and be around nature and fresh air, your mind will thank you.

## Yoga & Meditation:

Yoga and meditation are both proven to relieve stress, make your body and mind feel better, and make you a calmer and more relaxed person. There are tons of free Yoga classes on YouTube that you can join in with, whether you are a beginner or have done it before.

Meditation is also useful to help disconnect and relax, even though it is difficult to master! Incorporating things like Yoga and Meditation into your life can really help with your wellbeing.

## Read a book:

Whether it is a book related to your work or study, or just a fun book that you enjoy, reading is a fantastic way to disconnect from your screen. It still allows you to take in information, but also just relax and unwind at the same time.

Pick up that book you have put off reading and have some me time.

## Spend time with family and friends:

Spending time with real people can help with your mental health. Social interaction can make it easier to cope with stress, especially as talking about our lives and any issues we have helps too.

Try and spend time with your family and friends whether it is going for a coffee, having dinner together, going on a walk.

## Take a nap:

Sleep is super important to our health, and it is recommended that adults get between 7-9 hours of it every night.

If you have nothing else to do and just want to relax, and screen time is not an option then just take a decent quality nap! Napping can help you be more productive and increase productivity, and lets you catch up on that missed sleep.

## Make sure to always look after yourself and put yourself first. We hope that these 5 tips might help you to take a little more time away from the screen to better yourself and your health.
