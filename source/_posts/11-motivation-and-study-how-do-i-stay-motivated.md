Most of us find it hard to get motivated to study, or to stay motivated for long periods when studying!

Let's face it, it is so easy to get sucked into scrolling through your social media feed or watching one more YouTube video.

But when you have goals/deadlines/exams, staying motivated is essential and can be what stops you from achieving your goals and dreams.

## Firstly - What is motivation?

Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-orientated behaviors.

It’s what causes you to act, whether it is getting a glass of water to reduce thirst or reading a book to gain knowledge. Motivation serves as a guiding force for all human behaviour and understanding how it works and what it means can be important in a number of ways.

Here are just a few ways that you can stay motivated through your study!

## Get into a study routine

It is generally easier to stay motivated if studying becomes part of your everyday routine and life.

Once something becomes a habit, it is much easier to do! This is what you can do with your study.

Block out a period in your day that is designated for study time only, whether that be 1-2 hours in the evening or 9am-4pm. Make sure that you start studying at the time that you set yourself in your routine and try to stick to it as best as you can.

Eliminate all distractions during this time and set up yourself a dedicated study area to work from.

Make this routine your norm, and it will soon become a habit and be easier to do every day.

## Take breaks

Make sure to take regular breaks if you are studying for long periods of time!

Studies have shown that regular breaks can improve mental performance and help you learn and work better. It is essential to take breaks (even if its 5-10 minutes) away from your book or screen, to help you study better! Go on a walk, make a coffee, go speak to someone.

## Break the task down into manageable chunks

When you have a big task to do, such as a big piece of material to revise/remember or a large dissertation to write you may feel demotivated as the tasks seems so big.

If you break down the task into more manageable chunks it can make it seem less daunting, and easier to accomplish. Give yourself clear sections on what you are working on and break your work up into sections.

This will give you more to tick off your to-do list as completed, and make the task seem more manageable!

## Reward yourself

Reward yourself! Sounds good right?

Every time you complete one or two chunks of work / a section of your revision / a mock exam, reward yourself!

This could be with a short period of relaxation, a nice drink, taking 5-10 minutes to respond to friends/family or play a game on your phone.

Make these rewards short and enjoyable, and something to look forward to so that you get that task done!

## Check in with classmates

If you are studying at home on your own, it can be hard to feel connected with your classmates.

Make sure to check in with your classmates, whether that be in person or virtually! Maintaining social relationships is important for your mental wellbeing and speaking with other students can help boost your moral!

A friendly face or a few words of encouragement are only ever a video call or a WhatsApp message away.

## Remember your end goal

Remember your end goal when you are finding it hard to stay motivated throughout your study.

Why are you studying? What do you want to achieve?

Is procrastinating going to help you achieve your end goal?

Remember what you are trying to achieve and let that be your motivator. Every tick you make on your to do list is bringing you a step closer to your end goal, just keep that in mind!

## Don’t let your studying take over your life

Try not to let your studying completely take over your life.

It is important to have a healthy study/life balance.

You still need to make time for relaxation, socialising, exercise, and all of the things that you enjoy alongside your study. Don't let your study take over every hour and day of your week! Make sure that you build in time for the other things that you enjoy and that make you happy.

## Don’t expect to feel motivated all the time

You can't expect to feel motivated all the time. Don't rely on the feeling of motivation to get your work done, as sometimes it just won't be there.

We all have down days, and days where we don't want to do anything. This is why these kinds of tips can help you to stay on task and study even when you aren't feeling the most motivated. Use your discipline and stay on track, no matter if you are feeling motivated or not that day!

## We hope that this article helps you boost your motivation and understand how to manage your studying better!
