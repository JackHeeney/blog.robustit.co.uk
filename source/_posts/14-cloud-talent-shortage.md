We are currently amid a talent drought within the IT market, which is plaguing businesses and organisations.

IT infrastructure transformation is happening, and businesses are looking for efficiency and the desire to gain and keep the competitive advantage through faster innovation. This is why many businesses and organisations are transitioning to the Cloud, and keeping up with the latest tech and innovations.

However, there aren’t yet enough IT professionals with the expertise needed in the cloud.

There is a high demand for cloud-skilled professionals, and a huge number of jobs out there if you have the skills and certifications. But not enough people out there with the certifications!

## Digital transformations like this require highly technical skills, including specialised expertise that many companies do not already have in house.

With a rising uptake in 2020, many IT infrastructure and operations leaders are discovering skills gaps, both on the technical side — missing the software engineering skills critical for programmable infrastructures, for example — and in realizing the full potential of public cloud services like AWS and Azure.

Advanced cloud and security skills are in higher demand than ever before; however, there is a significant lack of qualified, skilled professionals to support this movement towards innovation, especially in non-tech related industries such as manufacturing, transportation, travel, and education.

Are you doing all you can to upskill yourself and or your employees to the Cloud?

We have a full Cloud based package, that is made up of 7 professional certifications to get you started in your cloud career.

Including the AZ-900, SC-900, AWS, MD-100, CompTIA Network+, AZ-104, and MCEAE Office 365.

These certifications will enable you to get a role in the Cloud sector, and get started in your career.

You don’t need any prior experience or knowledge to take our Cloud package, as it assumes no prior knowledge. But if you are already working in IT, and want to transition into a Cloud role then it is ideal for you also.

The pace of innovation isn’t likely to slow anytime soon.
