If you are planning on investing your money and time into a course and studying, then you need to make sure to choose the right one for you. There are lots of things to consider, and you need to remember to look into each and every one and make an informed decision before you invest your valuable time and money!

So how do you pick the right one?

{% fancybox https://www.robustittraining.com/blog/assets/img/post-sample-training-provider.jpg  %}

These are some questions that you may want to ask yourself before making that big decision!

## What do they specialize in?

Make sure that the training provider you go with specialize in the industry that you are looking to go into, so that you get the best experience possible.

We at Robust IT are an industry-leading IT and Project Management training company, and we have courses in Amazon Web Services, Cyber Security, Microsoft and many more areas and specialisms. We have a wide range of courses available to suit everyone and their needs, no matter if you’re a beginner or an expert.

Here are just some of our courses:

<strong>PRINCE2, CEH (v11), CompTIA Network+, CCNA , AWS: Intermediate, Microsoft Office Specialist and many more!</strong>

## Who are the founders?

Who are the founders of the training company and what is their background? This is important to make sure that you are buying into a company with experienced and industry-leading founders.

Our founders, Darren and Rizwan founded Robust in 2011 following successful careers in the IT industry!

Darren started in the industry working as a Trainer, meaning that he has the knowledge and expertise that is needed to work with students and develop the best courses and packages out there. Rizwan completed his BSc in Computer Science, and then went on to do a MSc in Distributed Systems and Networks, before he met Darren and they started Robust IT!

Our founders are both industry-leading experts with a vast amount of experience in the field, meaning that they have designed Robust IT and our courses to the highest standard possible.

## How long do I have to complete my study?

If you are looking to study a course, you need to know the timeframe in which the training provider gives you to complete your course!

We provide you with 2 years (that’s right 2 years) worth of access to our courses, giving you plenty of time to study and achieve. We know that you have your own life, meaning a full-time job, a family, other commitments etc. and that it can be super difficult to fit in studying around that. But with 2 years of access, you can take your time and study as and when you can.

## What payment options do they have?

All providers offer different prices and payment options, and it’s an important point to consider when choosing the right provider.

We strive to keep our price point lower than our competitions, and we offer various payment options. You are able to break the cost of your training down to monthly installments to suit you and your budget. This makes our training affordable and doable, even if you don’t have the budget right now.

## What support will I receive?

As a student, you deserve support from the company you are signing up to study with! All providers will offer different support systems and options, with various levels of support.

Our dedicated Customer Service team are always on standby to provide students with 1-1 support whenever required. We also have an In-House Recruitment team, that are here to help you with your CV, cover letters, LinkedIn, and to find your first role in the industry!

Our team are here to support you every step of the way, even when your course is done!

## How can I study?

Studying online is more popular than ever, and different providers will offer you different classroom/online options so make sure that the one you choose gives you the flexibility that you want!

With Robust you have the option to either study fully online, or come into our classrooms in London, Essex, Birmingham, or Manchester to study! This gives you full flexibility of how you want to study and complete your course. You can do everything fully from the comfort of your own home as long as you have an internet connection, or come in and study in classroom.

There are many other things to consider, but these are just a few of the important ones to keep at the top of your mind!

Choosing the right training provider is a tricky task, and you should always do your research and shop around before committing to anything and consider all of your options.

We hope that this article has given you a bit of insight into what to look for and what to think about, and taught you a bit about what Robust IT offers.
